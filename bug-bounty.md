**What is a Bug Bounty program? 🐜**

A bug bounty program is where crypto software undergoes a series of security tests to identify bugs in the code. Computer experts report any vulnerabilities and exploits in the system.

Computer and programming enthusiasts penetrate a program to identify bugs. After bounty hunting, the bounty hunter gets rewards in the form of tokens. A bug bounty refers to a reward offered to ethical hackers who discover bugs in a system.

Since bounty programs are common, hunters can make full-time incomes from bounties. In these programs, the business often sets the scope of work and the reward for each.

Following contract and dApp deployment Univaults will initiate a series of Bug Bounty programs to locate and in turn rectify any flaws in our ecosystem with the prizes for the bounties ranging from $500 - $50, 000 depending on the severity of the issue put forward:
