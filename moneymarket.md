**What is the Univaults Moneymarket?**

Univaults now hosts a range of different cryptocurrencies, from stablecoins to altcoins. These cryptos can be borrowed for stable and variable interest rates or users can lend cryptocurrencies into liquidity pools and earn interest on deposits.

The service is completely decentralised in comparison to other lending platforms such as BlockFi and Nexo, requiring no KYC checks or limitations for users. Lending and borrowing are controlled by smart contracts that incentivise liquidity pools to remove the need to match the borrower to the lender.

The Univaults lending protocol incentivises a native token called UNVT. The UNVT token is used for governance and can be staked in return for fees and other rewards.

Univaults is a non-custodial service meaning cryptos are never stored directly with Univaults. Deposits are always controlled by the user.



**How to lend on Univaults?**

Users can deposit many different cryptocurrencies on Univaults in return for varying levels of interest. Some cryptocurrencies characteristically return higher yields than others, but interest rates are constantly changing.

To deposit funds on Univaults you will need to connect to the site using a web 3.0 digital wallet such as Metamask or Trust wallet:

On the Univaults homepage, click "deposit" next to the asset that you would like to lend. Enter an amount and confirm the transaction through your web 3.0 wallet. Once the transaction is complete you will then receive the associated mTokens in your digital wallet. These mTokens will then begin to accrue interest.



**mTokens**

mTokens stand for Univaults interest-bearing moneymerket tokens.

Cryptocurrency deposits made to Univaults result in the creation of derivative tokens â€“ mTokens. These mTokens are pegged 1:1 to the value of the deposited cryptocurrency.

If 100 DAI were deposited onto Univaults, the user would then receive 100 mDAI tokens. The 100 mDAI would earn interest and could either be exchanged for the original asset on Univaults, or traded on any other DeFi platform that supported them.



**How to borrow on Univaults?**

Users can borrow from any of the cryptocurrency pools listed on Univaults for both variable and stable interest rates. To do so users will need access to a web 3.0 digital wallet:

Before borrowing, users must deposit a digital asset to be used as collateral. The amount available to borrow will correlate to the amount deposited as collateral. Note, all loans are over-collaterised, meaning that the deposit has to be larger than the loan. After depositing collateral, on the Univaults home page find the cryptocurrency that you wish to borrow. Click "borrow" on the right of the screen. You will then be prompted to connect your web 3.0 digital wallet. Once connected, choose the amount you would like to borrow. You must then select either a stable or variable interest rate for the loan. Choose the preferred interest rate and confirm the transaction through your web 3.0 digital wallet.



**Variable and stable interest rates**

Interest rates are changing constantly on Univaults and adapt depending on the utilisation of Univaults liquidity pools. This is known as the "utilisation rate".

When a large amount of capital is in the liquidity pools, interest rates remain low to encourage users to take out loans. When capital is limited, interest rates increase to offer incentives to lenders and encourage borrowers to return funds.

Variable interest rates vary with the demand in the Univaults markets. Variable rates can offer lower interest rate fees but that depends on market conditions. The inconsistent nature means variable rates are not ideal for long-term financial planning. Where you might have an excellent rate one week, the next could offer something much lower.

In comparison, stable interest rates provide a more predictable rate for the borrower. Note, stable interest rates are not the same as traditional fixed interest rates. They can still move. But they are a much more stable form of variable interest rates that remain less affected by market volatility. Due to the benefit of predictability, stable interest rates are often higher than variable interest rates.



**Swap stable for variable rates**

Borrowers can swap a variable rate for a fixed rate and vice versa. This provides the user with the freedom to get the best interest rate possible at any given time.

Users can swap between variable and stable interest rates at any time by visiting the dashboard and by clicking the "APR type" switch button.

How does the Univaults token work?

UNVT is the native token to the Univaults lending protocol.

Univaults primary use case is governance of the Univaults protocol, ensuring decentralised control of the platform. It provides holders with the opportunity to vote on items such as the management of the platform, improvement proposals and the allocation of funds.



**Staking**

Along with governance, the UNVT token can also be staked on the Univaults platform in return for staking rewards.

UNVT holders are utilised to lend their tokens into a liquidity pool called the "safety module". The Univaults safety module is used to cover lenders in case of a capital shortage. If required, UNVT tokens in the safety module can be sold for the digital assets that are needed to pay out lenders.

Lenders of UNVT collect protocol fees and other rewards.
