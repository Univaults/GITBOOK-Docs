# Flash loans

**Flash loans**

Univaults aims to be a key developer of flash loans in the DeFi lending sector. Flash loans are loans where there is no requirement for collateral.

No collateral is required because the flash loans must be issued and settled within a single block on the Ethereum blockchain. If the borrowed liquidity is not returned the whole transaction is cancelled just as though nothing was borrowed in the first place. This leaves no risk to Univaults and no risk to the borrower. Univaults will issue a 0.05% fee for the use of a flash loan, at the time of writing.

Flash loans are primarily used to take advantage of trading or arbitrage opportunities for larger investors.



**The process works like this:**

1. A borrower requests funds in the form of a flash loan.
2. They instantly use the funds to take advantage of an arbitrage opportunity between two decentralised exchanges.
3. Once the transaction is complete, the flash loan is returned to Univaults with the additional 0.05% charge.
4. The borrower keeps whatever profits were accumulated from the arbitrage.
5. Although a truly innovative approach made possible by the DeFi space, flash loans do come with their risks of losing on the gas fee.
