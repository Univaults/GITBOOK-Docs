# Stake

**Farms**

Yield farming involves staking tokens (either liquidity paired tokens or single tokens) to earn additional tokens. The purpose is to incentivize holders to provide additional liquidity to the project to help improve buying/selling pressure.\
In $UNVT, adding Liquidity for the BNB pairs and native pairs can be done by purchasing tokens and then pairing it together using the Add Liquidity button on the menu. There are no fees to stake in Univaults, thus you can stake and unstake as many times as you wish. APR (Annual percentage return) represents the yield you will get in $UNVT, as expressed in dollars, therefore the APR fluctuates based on:

1. How many others are in the pool / farm
2. The current price of UNVT



**Native LP Pairs**

Unlike most yield farms we only allow native token pairs to prevent whales from dumping on UNVT.

Pair the following LP to earn $UNVT :&#x20;

UNVT-BNB LP&#x20;

UNVT-ETH LP&#x20;

BUSD-BNB LP



**Partnership LP Pairs**

Pair our partnership's tokens to our native token to earn $UNVT. Partnerships will be announced in the coming months:&#x20;

PARTNER 1: TBA&#x20;

PARTNER 2: TBA&#x20;

PARTNER 3: TBA&#x20;

PARTNER 4: TBA&#x20;

PARTNER 5: TBA&#x20;

PARTNER 6: TBA



**Pools**

A pool is a simpler farm. Instead of putting tokens together in an LP, you can just stake single tokens! We offer this for the following tokens:&#x20;
