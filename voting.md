# Voting

**Voting Explained**

The UNVT Genesis governance architecture's smart contracts components are as follows:

✅ UnivaultsGovernance: A core component of governance which stores the state related to each submitted proposal, allows voting by the UNVT token holders and permits the execution of approved proposals. This contract will have the ownerships needed to execute proposals containing all the bootstrapping actions of the Univaults ecosystem.

✅ AssetVotingWeightProvider: Defines weights a voter can vote on proposals. Only UNVT tokens will be allowed to vote, with a weight of 1 (1 token = 1 vote).
