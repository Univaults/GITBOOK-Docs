**Collateral Swap**

The collateral swap feature allows the user to swap supplied liquidity in one asset type to another asset type without a separate withdrawal and supply transaction (e.g., swapping aUSDC to aDAI in a single transaction). The user must approve the contract to pull mTokens in order to successfully swap liquidity.

**Supported Markets**&#x20;

**​​ Repay With mTokens**

Repay with mTokens with the Univaults protocol native feature, which allows the user to repay borrowed assets with supplied liquidity of the same asset type in the pool (e.g., repay borrowed USDC with aUSDC). Additional details can be located below.

**Supported Markets**&#x20;

The repay with mTokens feature is available on all mainnet and testnet markets: TBA ​​ ​​ ​​&#x20;



**Staking**

An UNVT holder can stake their UNVT in the Safety Module to enhance protocol solvency and earn Safety Incentives. Upon the occurrence of a shortfall event, up to 30% of the token holder’s stake can be slashed to cover the deficit, providing an additional risk mitigation mechanism for the protocol. The staking option is only available on Ethereum and Binance Smart Chain Mainnet. Learn more about staking risks in the following Docs: TBA



**Snapshot Voting**

The governance dApp is a designated place for voters to gauge the community sentiment for on-chain votes and decide off-chain proposals. Voting on Snapshot proposals is done via a gasless signature and is compatible with a variety of assets and chains. A list of available voting strategies can be viewed or queried in Realtime via the following Docs: TBA



**On-Chain Governance**

On chain governance​ allows holders of UNVT to vote and propose changes and/or upgrades to the protocol and governance. The governance process is described in more detail. Univaults Governance is only enabled on Ethereum mainnet and the Binance Smart Chain Mainnet.



**Cross-Chain Governance Bridges**

Univaults will down the line enable a new feature integrated on chains that support cross-chain messaging.

All voting for Univaults Governance proposals occurs on Ethereum mainnet and BSC. Governance bridges will be used to take the result of proposal voting on Ethereum mainnet and BSC to execute proposals on other chains. The following Docs contain the technical implementation for cross-chain bridges.

The cross-chain bridge is currently available on the following networks: TBA
