# Bridge

The Univaults Bridge currently allows for you to move your tokens from ERC-20 (ETH Network) to BEP-20 (Binance Smart Chain) or vice versa thereby increasing the scope of coverage and suppressing the supply on a single chain.

Univaults aims to connect 6 other chains in the coming months and therefore creating a fluid moneymarket where the UNVT token is barrierless to be transferred between the following networks: ETH, BSC, AVAX, FTM, KCC, ADA, DOT, SOL

The bridge works by burning your tokens in the source chain and minting the same value in the destination chain.



**Step by step guide on how to use the bridge**

Step 1: Connect your Metamask to Main Ethereum Network (Required)&#x20;

Step 2: Approve you UNVT to ETH-BSC Bridge&#x20;

Step 3: Set the amount of UNVT that you want to convert to UNVT on BSC then click "Next". Fee for bridge will stand at, and always remain at 1%.&#x20;

Step 4: When you click "Next", the pop-up will display on your screen. You can click to choose "I have read and agree to the terms" then confirm your transaction.&#x20;



NOTE \*: The same flow of events (Step 1-4) will apply when transferring in the opposite direction from BSC-ETH.
