**What is an AMM Exchange**?

Automated market makers (AMM) are decentralized exchanges that pool liquidity from users and price the assets within the pool using algorithms. The exact mechanics vary from exchange to exchange, but generally, AMMs offer deep liquidity, low transaction fees, and 100% uptime for as many users as possible. AMM's utilize an algorithm, usually x \* y = k, to provide everyone trading with the pool a constant price.
