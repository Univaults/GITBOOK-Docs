One of a number of new and emerging DeFi cryptocurrencies, Univaults is a decentralized lending system that allows users to lend, borrow and earn interest on crypto assets, all without middlemen.

Running primarily on the Ethereum blockchain and Binance Smart Chain, Univaults is a system of smart contracts that enables these assets to be managed by a distributed network of computers running its software.

This means Univaults users do not need to trust a particular institution or person to manage their funds. They need only trust that its code will execute as written.

At its core, the Univaults software enables the creation of lending pools that enable users to lend or borrow a abundance of different cryptocurrencies such as ETH, BSC, BUSD, USDT, AXAX and many more.

Like other decentralized lending systems on Ethereum, Univaults borrowers must post collateral before they can borrow. Further, they can only borrow up to the value of the collateral they post unless the user were to complete the transaction in one block using Univaults flash loan documentation.

Borrowers receive funds in the form of a special token known as an mToken (moneymarket token), which is pegged to the value of another asset. This token is then encoded so lenders receive interest on deposits. mTokens (moneymarket tokens) are tokens minted and burnt upon supply and withdraw of assets to an Univaults market, which denote the amount of crypto assets supplied and the yield earned on those assets. The **m**Tokensâ€™ value is pegged to the value of the corresponding supplied asset at a 1:1 ratio and can be safely stored, transferred or traded.

A borrower may post collateral in DAI, for example, and borrow in ETH. This allows a borrower to gain exposure to different cryptocurrencies without owning them outright.

Univaults can also introduce additional features, such as instant loans, and other forms of issuing debt and credit that take advantage of the unique design properties of blockchains and bridge traditional finance with DeFi in a way not seen before.
