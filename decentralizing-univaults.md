# Decentralizing Univaults

**Introduction to Univaults Governance**

Conflict dynamics amongst open or closed governance can produce unfocused goals and lead to suboptimal decisions. Multilevel governance is more efficient as market participants must operate under the realm of agreed risk standards and higher-level policies. UNVT token holders bear the risk of the protocol. Stakeholders contribute in more tangible ways to the protocol, usually in the form of technical integration (DeFi Front End, integrations etc.) or financial participation (Liquidity Provider). Both have some expectations for the protocol behaviour, safety and functionality. The Univaults Protocol codifies trust between stakeholders (UNVT token holders, Vote delegates, Market Manager, Liquidity Providers and integrators). Moreover, although this implementation of multilevel governance cannot practically solve voter apathy, our liquidity-based governance creates economic incentives that keep the voting pool active and renewed as new UNVT participants become potential voters. The incentives design resulting from multilevel governance encourages participants to become risk aware as they are economically co-dependent on each other and the protocol while allowing more flexibility between market operators.

This UNVT proposal is designed as a catalyst for the growth and long-term governance of the Univaults Protocol. The goal is to create a future-proof framework which relies on systemic incentives and multilevel governance to create an efficient equilibrium that stimulates long-term growth and optimization of the protocol.



**❔ Voting power on a blockchain project ❔**

Governance tokens are cryptocurrencies that represent voting power on a blockchain project. As of recently, they are mostly integrated into DeFi projects since they need to distribute powers and rights to users in order to remain decentralized.
