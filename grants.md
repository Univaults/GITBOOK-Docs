4\.  Ecosystem Grants Programme

Applicable scope: Medium to Large scale projects

The Ecosystem Grants Programme targets medium to large-scale and self-contained projects, and is open to general application. It involves a more comprehensive evaluation of the projects and teams, with feedback from Several Audit firms and the community via GitHub Discussions page and on-chain governance.

Grants are approved in multiple phases. Projects that are beneficial to the ecosystem and have great potential are usually granted initial funding to support the development of an MVP. If the MVP receives positive feedback from the community, it may be further funded to continue its development.
