# Framework

**Risk Management**

Univaults brings a greatly improved set risk parameters and features to protect the protocol from insolvency.



**Supply and Borrow Caps**

The Univaults governance configures Borrow and Supply Caps.

**Borrow Caps**: allow to modulate how much of each asset can be borrowed, which reduces insolvency risk. Supply Caps: allow to limit how much of a certain asset is supplied to the Univaults protocol. This helps reducing exposure to a certain asset and mitigate attacks like infinite minting or price oracle manipulation.



**Granular Borrowing Power Control**

In Univaults, it will be possible to lower the borrowing power of any asset to as low as 0% without any impact on existing borrowers.



**Risk Admins**

Univaults introduces the ability for the Univaults Governance to grant entities permission to update the risk parameters with going through governance vote for every change. These entities can be DAOs or automated agents that can build on top of this feature to react automatically in case of unanticipated events. Univaults Governance will have the ability to revoke access to existing Risk Admins or add new Risk Admins.
